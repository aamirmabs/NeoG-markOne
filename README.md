# NeoG Camp - markOne

The NeoG Camp is an initiative taken up by Tanay Pratap to introduce young minds to learn skills that are in-demand in the software industry in structured manner with the end goal of successfully mentoring a handful of motivated individuals and enable them to break into the industry.

The camp takes a bootcamp style approach with weekly coding sessions live streamed on YouTube where core concepts are explained in a practical manner by building something. Participants are required to then build something that demonstrates their understanding of the concepts.

## markOne

This repository is the first assignment of the camp to be submitted in the first week.

The task to be implemented is as follows:

- Build a CLI app which can quiz users on a certain topic.
- Use nodeJS.
- Use repl.it to host the app.
- This should be similar to the app made in lesson One of levelZero.
